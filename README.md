Heap Data Structures

The repository contains the Python file heap_data_structures.py, which implements Heapsort. It also compares it with Quicksort and Merge Sort. 

How to Run

One needs to run the script to get the output of the sorting algorithm comparison. The script also performs the priority queue operations, including task insertion and extractions. 

Summary of Findings 

The finding is that heapsort is a reliable O(n log n) sorting algorithm regardless of the input distributions. Priority queue was found to be efficient in task management.
